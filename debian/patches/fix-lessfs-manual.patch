 When MIN_SPACE_CLEAN is configured the program specified by CLEAN_PROGRAM will be executed. This program/script can be used to warn the administator or automatically delete old files. Please note that when CLEAN_PROGRAM is used with the file_io backend deleting files from lessfs will not free disk space on the underlying filesystem since file_io only marks deleted blocks as free in the freelist database.

 This option is only valid for a lessfs slave. When configured the slave will not listen to REPLICATION_LISTEN_IP, instead it will search for replication logfiles in the path specified. The files need to be named replog.dta-SEQUENCENUMBER as they where created by the master. The slave does not wait for incomming files to be complete. So when the files are copied you should copy them to a file with a different name, like .replog.dta-SEQUENCENUMBER and rename the file when the transfer has completed. When the slave has processed the file it will rename it to replog.dta-SEQUENCENUMBER-processed.
 .IP REPLICATION_LISTEN_PORT=201
 The port on which the slave will listen.

+.IP "REPLICATION_ENABLED=off (default) or on"
 When enabled all data stored on the master is directly send to the slave. When disabled the master will write data stored in a replog file as well as it's databases. The replog file will be used to transfer the data to the slave when replication becomes enabled.
-.IP MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE=0 (default)
+.IP "MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE=0 (default)"
 The replication master uses a backlog file to queue data that has to be sent to the slave. When MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE configured to be greater then zero the master will pause with accepting new writes as soon as the backlog exceeds MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE. As soon as the replication backlog becomes smaller then MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE the master will resume accepting incomming writes.
 .IP STICKY_ON_LOCKED=off
 Valid options are : off (default) or on
