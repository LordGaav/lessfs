 .SH DESCRIPTION
-\fBlessfs\fR is a filesystem that performs inline data deduplication. lessfs uses the 192-bit (24-byte) tiger hash algorithm by default to compare the data. The filesystem compresses the unique data blocks before writing them to disk.

 .SH GENERAL FILESYSTEM INFO
 Lessfs locks a file during truncation. As long as the file is locked only read operations will be executed, all write operations are suspended until the truncation process is completed. Files that are write locked will be visible in /.lessfs/locks/ where they will show up as a file with the inodenumber of the locked file as filename.
