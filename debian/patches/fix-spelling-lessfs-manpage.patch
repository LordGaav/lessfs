 When MIN_SPACE_CLEAN is configured the program specified by CLEAN_PROGRAM will be executed. This program/script can be used to warn the administator or automatically delete old files. Please note that when CLEAN_PROGRAM is used with the file_io backend deleting files from lessfs will not free disk space on the underlying filesystem since file_io only marks deleted blocks as free in the freelist database.

As soon as the replication backlog becomes smaller then MAX_BACKLOG_SIZE the master will resume accepting incomming writes.
